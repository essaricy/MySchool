Step 1: Client Side Integration
Paste this snippet before the closing </head> tag on your HTML template:
<script src='https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js'></script>
Paste this snippet at the end of the <form> where you want the reCAPTCHA widget to appear:
<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6LfuRAcUAAAAADlao8Xuehf1BuJR4uvGKkU_kcSf"></div>

Step 2: Server side integration
When your users submit the form where you integrated reCAPTCHA, you'll get as part of the payload a string with the name "g-recaptcha-response". In order to check whether Google has verified that user, send a POST request with these parameters:
URL: https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify
secret (required)	6LeZRQcUAAAAAKEaTxRq15lE0MY1jshHcySsvbn3
response (required)	The value of 'g-recaptcha-response'.
remoteip	The end user's ip address.
